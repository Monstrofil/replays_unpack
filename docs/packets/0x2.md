# Packet 0x2

Packet corresponds to this client function call:

```
/**
 *	This function is called to tell us that we may now control the given
 *	entity (or not as the case may be).
 *
 *	@param	id			entity id.
 *	@param	control		true if entity is now controlled, false otherwise.
 */
void EntityManager::onEntityControl( EntityID id, bool control )
```

And here how it looks like:

```
struct EntityEnter {
    int32 entityID;
    bool isControlled;
}
```
